# Temage
We are happy to announce our newest project: Temage! (like an image, but in the terminal) Temage is a file format for rendering pixel art in your terminal!

You can create such images by using the built-in crappy editor included within the tool.

So as long as you're on Linux, what are you waiting for? [Download it now!](https://github.com/Squirrelcoding/temage)
